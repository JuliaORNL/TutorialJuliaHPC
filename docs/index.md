# Welcome to the Julia for High-performance Computing Tutorial

## Goal

The goal of the tutorial is to introduce an audience familiar with high-performance computing (HPC) concepts to the Julia programming language using a hands-on approach.

{: .info}
It's a good time to get the latest Julia installed from their [website](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Covered:
- Workflow aspects: simulation CPU/CPU, parallel I/O, data analysis (e.g. Notebooks)
- Multiple dispatch for array back ends (CPU, GPU: CUDA, AMDGPU)
- Multithreaded CPU using Julia @threads
- GPU programming using vendor (CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl) and performance portable layer (JACC.jl, KernelAbstractions.jl)
- Parallel I/O with ADIOS2.jl (outputs can be visualized in ParaView locally)
- Julia on OLCF's JupyterHub and Pluto.jl Notebooks (read and plot using Makie.jl)

## Not Covered (future topics?):
- More general aspects of the language (software engineering, AI)
- AI infrastructure: Flux.jl, SciML
- Ahead-of-time compilation: PackageCompiler.jl
- Tools ecosystem for profiling, debugging (well some vendor supported)

# Why Julia?

{: .highlight }
"Can a machine translate a sufficiently rich mathematical language into a suffienciently economical program at a sufficiently low cost to make the whole affair feasible?" 
-- John Backus on Fortran (1980)

1. Compiled via LLVM for performance. **Julia is Compiled**
2. Provides a unified **tested** ecosystem (packaging, testing, tools, interactivity, etc.). See JuliaCon [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YWwiFbaRx8) on GeneralRegistry.
3. Community of HPC people from day-1 (the community is you, low entry barrier)
4. Sustained by [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/), MIT's JuliaLab, NumFocus and several open-source [contributors](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/02/julia-entities/)
5. Great math (Fortran) and data science (Python) simple syntax
6. Rapid prototyping: stay in one language+ecosystem for your custom kernels + data analysis
7. Interoperate with Fortran, C, C++ (via C), Python, R code in a lightweight manner
8. Renewed interest for high-performance + high-productivity languages
9. Great first language to expose newcomers to both HPC + math concepts
10. Contribute to HPC stack: MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl, KernelAbstractions.jl, JACC.jl, ADIOS2.jl, HDF5.jl...for us, by us

![](images/Blog_2303_julia_value_proposition.png)**Julia's value proposition**

# Why not Julia?

1. Already existing infrastructure/expertise (Fortran is perfect!)
2. Too much of an investment to learn a new language
3. Performance/productivity solutions already in place
4. Having N-language/ecosystems is not a problem
5. Python + X is well supported for your needs
6. Garbage collection, Just-in-time (JIT) compilation are issues
7. Developing low-level system libraries
8. Domain outside "technical computing"
9. Overall, you do not see any value added
